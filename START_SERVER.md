# How to Start the Server

## Important: Keep the Server Running!

When you run `npm run dev`, the server needs to **stay running**. Don't close the terminal window!

## Steps:

1. **Open a PowerShell terminal** in your project folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Sheida\Music\my_cursor_apps\Linked in generatior certificate"
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for this message:**
   ```
   ✓ Ready in X seconds
   - Local: http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Keep the terminal window open!** 
   - The server is now running
   - Don't close this window
   - You can minimize it, but don't close it

5. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## To Stop the Server:

- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- Or close the terminal window

## To Run in Background (Advanced):

If you want to use the terminal for other things, you can:
- Open a **second terminal window** for other commands
- Keep the first one running the server
